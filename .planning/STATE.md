### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- RGB tint instead of per-layer HSV controls for simpler UI
- Unified color pipeline for all engines ensures consistent aesthetic
- Each new engine gets one preset in v1 (expand later)
- EMA smoothing for safe sliders prevents organism death from parameter changes
