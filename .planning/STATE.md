# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Beautiful, constantly-evolving organic imagery that feeds Scope's pipeline — every system alive, iridescent, never black.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Iridescent Color Pipeline (in progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Iridescent Color Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1/1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | 1/2 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 02-01 (3 min)
- Trend: Consistent (3 min avg)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Cosine palette system for mathematical iridescent gradients (Phase 2)
- Multi-channel signal mapping (density/edges/velocity) drives spatial color variation (Phase 2)
- LFO-synchronized hue sweep ties color animation to breathing (Phase 2)
- Remove feedback system - color is purely visual (Phase 2)
- Four palette presets, default to cuttlefish for bioluminescent aesthetic (Phase 2)
- Replace 4-layer color system with iridescent pipeline for oil-slick shimmer aesthetic
- RGB tint instead of per-layer HSV controls for simpler UI
- Unified color pipeline for all engines ensures consistent aesthetic
- Pure sinusoidal phase accumulators replace velocity-based physics oscillator (Phase 1)
- Three independent LFO frequencies create organic polyrhythmic breathing (Phase 1)
