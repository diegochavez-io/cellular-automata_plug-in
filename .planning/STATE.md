# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Beautiful, constantly-evolving organic imagery that feeds Scope's pipeline — every system alive, iridescent, never black.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 complete. Ready for Phase 3 - Safe Parameter Control.

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (Safe Parameter Control) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: Plan 03-01 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (EMA smoothing infrastructure)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 5.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1/1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | 2/2 | 15 min | 8 min |
| 3 | 1/4 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 02-01 (3 min), 02-02 (12 min), 03-01 (5 min)
- Trend: Stabilizing around 5-8 minutes per plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Varied EMA time constants (mu=2.0s, sigma=2.2s, T=2.5s) for organic parameter independence (Phase 3)
- Coupling strength 0.5 balances organism viability with user agency (Phase 3)
- Invisible Gaussian rescue (no seed/reset) for organic recovery (Phase 3)
- LFO sets targets, EMA smooths output for layered dreamy breathing (Phase 3)
- 2D LUT optimization (256×256→uint8) for pipeline performance (Phase 2)
- oil_slick palette with c=2.0 frequency for richest multi-hue variation (Phase 2)
- Hue locked to LFO breath cycles (8% per breath, ~12 breaths full cycle) (Phase 2)
- Non-linear alpha power 0.25 for translucent fluffy depth (Phase 2)
- Bioluminescent edge specks at high-gradient boundaries (Phase 2)
- Pure sinusoidal phase accumulators replace velocity-based physics oscillator (Phase 1)
- Three independent LFO frequencies create organic polyrhythmic breathing (Phase 1)
