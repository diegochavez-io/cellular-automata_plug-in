# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Beautiful, constantly-evolving organic imagery that feeds Scope's pipeline — every system alive, iridescent, never black.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - LFO Smoothing (complete, pending verification)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (LFO Smoothing)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1/1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min)
- Trend: N/A (first plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Replace 4-layer color system with iridescent pipeline for oil-slick shimmer aesthetic
- RGB tint instead of per-layer HSV controls for simpler UI
- Unified color pipeline for all engines ensures consistent aesthetic
- Each new engine gets one preset in v1 (expand later)
- EMA smoothing for safe sliders prevents organism death from parameter changes
- Pure sinusoidal phase accumulators replace velocity-based physics oscillator (Phase 1)
- Three independent LFO frequencies create organic polyrhythmic breathing (Phase 1)

### Pending Todos
